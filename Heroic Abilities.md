# New Heroic Abilities

### Spellblade

**Requirements:** Any weapon skill 12, any magic skill 12

**Willpower**: 1

This ability allows you to cast a spell while holding (wielding or at-hand) a metal weapon. The willpower cost is paid after rolling to see if the spell cast succeeds, and is in addition to the cost of the spell. This ability also allows the character to use one weapon of their choice as a spellcasting focus. If the weapon is lost or broken, the character can attune to a replacement by meditating for a shift.

### Armored Spellcaster

**Requirement:** Spellblade

**Willpower:** 2

This ability allows you to cast a spell while wearing metal armor. The willpower cost is paid after rolling to see if the spell cast succeeds. If the character is both wielding a metal weapon and wearing metal armor, the costs are additive (3 willpower, in addition to the cost of the spell).
